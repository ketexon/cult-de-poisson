  Text: "Year 1 Day 207\r\nAfter observing the natives for a number of days, I have
    uncovered more about how they obtain their power. It appears as though the eel
    itself contains a voltage that can be converted to power other objects\u2013from
    simple volts to continuous streams emitting in lines. Perhaps I could harness
    this power to help accelerate their language development\u2026\r"
