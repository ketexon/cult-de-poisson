  Text: "Year 2 Day 116\r\nMy invention mirrors 19th century phonograms to project
    audio lines that induce hypnosis. This should accelerate the ingraining of vocabulary.

    on, questioning the mission. What teenagers know, deeming a project unethical
    when I am making these people more civilized. Too much time frolicking with the
    locals is to blame. Hopefully, she develops reason as she gets older.\r"
