  Text: "Year 1 Day 98\r\nThe others fear the unknown. I press on without them. High
    treetops, warm rays of sunlight, untamed foliage, leaves twice my frame\u2013how
    the mainland would be left in disbelief\u2026 one day they will all see it. I
    encountered <u>colorful inhabitants</u>, who seem to have advanced their civilization
    through <u>aquatic, possibly-supernatural powers.</u> Sadly, they are held back
    by religion. Their beliefs seem to prevent them from experimenting with the fish."
