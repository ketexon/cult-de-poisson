  Text: 'Year 1 Day 18

    Eighteen days after leaving the mainland, I have finally
    set foot upon an uncivilized island. I have set claim to this cove and begun
    preparations for a permanent settlement. I fear my crewmates discuss our return
    too soon. They overlook the treasure to be uncovered here. Men of future generations
    will honor my family, my son, and his children for pioneering a home for mankind.
    <u>Man has a responsibility to surface gold hidden beneath the sand.</u>'
