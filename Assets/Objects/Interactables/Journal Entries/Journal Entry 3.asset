  Text: "Year 1 Day 122\r\nThey have electricity but no form of verbal communication.
    My attempts at conversation with them have been rendered useless as they do not
    seem to understand nor wish to speak with me. It\u2019s all just meaningless
    symbols. I may be forced to simplify my thoughts-- Tomorrow, I shall return with
    simpler speech. In due time, I will educate them enough to speak with us about
    the island. We can\u2019t coexist without words.\r"
